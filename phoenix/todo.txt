# Todos

- Tighten networking rules, similar to what [Docker recently
  did](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-engine-28-hardening-container-networking-by-default/)


  - Networking
    - Add wireguard interface to container & setup namespaces
    - Add veth interface to container & setup namespaces
    - Clean up when container exits
  - Services should not be deleted from the _master_ database. They should be
    given a status of deleted, and their ip & wg keys retained. They _should_ be
    deleted from the minion, or treated differently on the minion.
  - todo format links correctly
  - Process supervision bug
  - Restarting a container that died needs to insure the network namespace is ok.
  - Publish it
  - Images need to be moved into place.
  - Test
